# Decisions (answered by Alex, 2026-06-06)

These were the open questions; this records the answers and how they were
applied. Open follow-ups live in `BACKLOG.md`.

## Resolved

1. **Map tiles** — Esri-only (free, no key) for now; add a Mapbox token later if
   imagery feels soft. _Applied: no change; Mapbox path stays optional via
   `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`._

2. **Bounding box** — keep the current St. Pete box for now; it's easy to change
   later. _Applied: unchanged. (See the multi-city plan — bbox becomes per-city
   data.)_

3 & 4. **Must-include / banned places** — none yet; Alex will provide lists
later. Each city should aim for **~200 places** (lots of restaurants/bars are
currently filtered out and should be added). _Applied: launch target updated
to ~200 in PLAN/BACKLOG; the curation step takes force-include/ban lists._

5. **Starting zoom** — start showing the **whole city**, let the player zoom in
   to place the pin (maptap-style). _Applied: already the behavior — map fits the
   full bounds on each round, min/max zoom allow zooming in to building level._

6. **Scoring** — **0–100 per round**, **linear**: 100 within **300 m**, down to
   0 at **5 km**. _Applied: `scoring.ts` (`MAX_ROUND_SCORE=100`, perfect radius
   300 m, `ZERO_DISTANCE_M=5000`, linear; polygon scoring later refined the
   radius per location type — see §5.4/POLYGON-SCORING.md). Share emoji tiers
   rescaled (🟩≥80 🟨≥50 🟧≥20 ⬛<20). Perfect day = 500._

7. **Clues** — **no clues by default** for now. _Applied: `SHOW_CLUES=false` in
   `Game.tsx`; clues remain in the data for later._

8. **Daily rollover** — switch at **midnight US Eastern**. _Applied: `getDateKey`
   uses `America/New_York` via `Intl` (DST-aware); each city now carries its own
   IANA timezone._

9. **Dataset size** — **~200 before launch** (more is better); anything is fine
   while prototyping. _Applied: target documented; current shipped set is 373 (plus 4 more cities)._

10. **Hosting** — free `github.io` for now (it is free for public repos); a
    **custom domain later** (name TBD). _Applied: repo made public; custom
    domain **knowyourcity.gg** bought at Porkbun and live as of 2026-06-10._

11. **Photos in v1** — keep **v1 text-only**; photos are a backlog item.
    _Applied: backlog updated; `photoUrl` field already in the schema._

## Still needed from Alex (later)

- Per-city **must-include** and **banned** lists.
- Whether to widen the St. Pete bbox to recapture the Old Sunshine Skyway pier
  and north-county golf (both fell just outside the current box).
- ~~The eventual custom domain name.~~ _Resolved: **knowyourcity.gg** (see #10)._

flow (CI green → squash-merge → branch auto-deleted). See `CLAUDE.md`.

## In progress / next

- [x] **Difficulty rollout — all cities done.** St. Pete (PR #40), **State
      College**, **Ann Arbor**, **Seattle**, and **Chicago** SHIPPED: every
      location has an `easy`/`medium`/`hard` `difficulty` (inverse of local fame,
      from a fame+status web-research pass), and the daily game runs **2 easy → 2
      medium → 1 hard** (layering category variety). Use the
      **`add-or-update-city` skill** for any future city — it runs the whole flow.
      See `docs/PLAN.md` §5.1b/§5.3b, `docs/DATA-SOURCING.md` §4b, and memory
      `difficulty-rating-research`. (Chicago's uncapped pass — 5325 fetched →
      4150 enriched, top 700 in play — ran crash-safe across ~5 session-limit
      resets via `scripts/gen-fame-workflow.mjs` + `harvest-fame-transcripts.mjs`.)
- [x] **Generalize difficulty enrichment.** `scripts/apply-difficulty.mjs <city>`
      is the generalized, re-runnable successor to the St. Pete one-off — status
      cleanup (closed/junk/national-chains/renames) + de-dupe + city-relative
      percentile bucketing (narrow-easy 20/45/35). Driven by the
      `add-or-update-city` skill + `scripts/fame-workflow.template.md`. (Still
      optional: fold it directly into `build-city` so a rebuild auto-enriches in one
      step.) **Note:** the +19 St. Pete parks/lakes (a one-off import, now living
      in `data/stpete-manual.json`) carry hand-assigned difficulty — fold them
      into St. Pete's next fame re-bucketing pass.
- [x] **St. Pete dataset** — inclusive food/drink via `fetch-food` + curated
      landmarks. Peaked at ~516; the fame+status pass (PR #40) then **trimmed it
      to 382** (removed 104 permanently-closed + 28 zero-presence junk + 1
      renamed-to-closed; updated 15 renames; merged 1 dupe). The +19 parks/lakes
      pass (PR #49) brought it to 401; the play-cap re-run (PR #59) re-deduped to
      389; issue-requested adds + nearby sweep (#50/#51) brought it to **396**;
      removing the closed DeSanto Bar (issue #81) brought it to **395**;
      +3 John's Pass Village adds (issue #85, Sculley's + nearby sweep) brought it
      to **398**; removing the closed McAuley's Pub (now The Local Draught House)
      brought it to **397**; a Google Places freshness sweep then re-pinned 7
      relocated venues, renamed 4 to their current successor, removed 5
      truly-closed, and added 4 new spots → 396; then removing 22 national chains
      that leaked past the original fame pass → 374; then a whole-fleet Places
      freshness sweep (−4 newly-closed, +3 successors, `lastVerified` stamps) →
      373; then the four-city full-vetting pass removed 3 long-closed resort
      venues → 370, then +3 re-added local-chain branches (#142) → 373, then +3
      player-request adds around the Horse & Jockey block (#146) → 376, −1
      in-stadium sub-space (Ballpark & Rec inside Tropicana Field) dropped as
      junk via issue #160 → 375, then +1 Central Pizza & Subs (6405 Central Ave)
      — the OSM "Central Pizza" node is the separate Pinellas Park venue, renamed
      in place to Off The Brick New York Pizza → 376, −1 The Neon Lunchbox
      (1756 Central Ave, closed 2026-08-29 per Patch; marked closed in the fame
      cache) → **375**
      (all in play — cap is 400).
- [ ] **Build new cities from OSM + Google Maps, not OSM alone** (owner directive,
      2026-06-16 — "OSM has outdated data"). `build-city.mjs` pulls only live
      Overpass today, so a new city can launch with stale closed/renamed pins (the
      St. Pete Places sweep, PR #102, found ~18). Cross-check candidates against the
      **Google Places API** (`business_status` to drop closed, current name for
      renames, `userRatingCount` as a fame/inclusion signal) during the
      `add-or-update-city` flow. Keep **committed coords from Nominatim/Census**
      (ODbL-clean) — Google verifies, doesn't get stored beyond `place_id`. Key is
      `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` in `.env.local`. (`build-city` already honors a
      `data/<city>-manual.json` **override layer** — a manual id that matches an OSM
      candidate replaces it — added in PR #103 so re-pins survive a rebuild.)
- [ ] **Precise popularity filter** — current inclusion uses an OSM
      "established business" proxy. A true "≥100 Yelp reviews" cut needs a paid
      Yelp/Google integration (ToS forbids storing their data long-term); the
      license-clean alternative is the Foursquare OS Places open dataset.
- [ ] **Closed-spot cleanup** — inclusive OSM pulls can include a few stale
      entries; maintain a per-city ban list / extend `CLOSED`. (St. Pete swept by
      the fame+status pass in PR #40 — 133 closed/junk removed; the other cities
      get the same sweep as part of their difficulty rollout above.)
- [ ] **Re-add relocated Chicago venues (post full-vetting, PR #145).** The
      2026-06-25 freshness+vetting pass removed 56 venues that had relocated >150 m
      (never-commit-moved-coords policy) — all are operational but at a stale pin.
      Re-add the in-bounds, currently-open ones cleanly via the `add-location`
      skill (Nominatim/Census coords, Google-calibrated fame). Prominent ones to
      prioritize: **Wild Hare** (moved to Fulton Market, 952 W Fulton St — note
      there are two dead slugs `wild-hare` + `the-wild-hare`; pick one, retire the
      other), **Iroquois Theatre Fire Memorial** (Nederlander/Oriental Theatre,
      in-bounds), **Steak 'n Egger**, **Shang Noodle** (Streeterville), **Serai**,
      **Ralph H. Metcalfe** (federal building). Skip out-of-bbox relocations
      (e.g. `afro-joes` → 1818 W 99th St, south of bounds) per the no-bounds-
      expansion rule. Full list of 56 in the PR #145 vetting decisions.
- [ ] **Bulk-fetch mode for `add-polygons`.** Per-location querying hits Overpass
      per-IP rate limits on large cities (Chicago = 764 rows, hours). A single
      bulk query for all named leisure/golf geometry in the city bbox, matched
      locally with the existing helpers, is dramatically faster and rate-limit-
      proof — Chicago was completed this way as a one-off. Fold it into the script
      (with tests). See `docs/DATA-SOURCING.md` §4d.
- [ ] **Strip OSM code-prefixed display names in the pipeline.** Some OSM nodes
      carry a survey-code prefix glued to the name (Chicago had `KE34-Cubs`,
      `KE14-The Cubby Bear`, `KE37-Harry Caray's`, `IC6-Gerald J Roper Gateway` —
      `park`-category points sitting kilometres from the famous venue whose name
      they borrow, so the fame agent name-matched them to spurious 60–97 scores).
      Chicago's were marked `uncertain` in `data/fame-chicago.json` and dropped on
      re-run, but the systemic fix is a `cleanDisplayName` step in
      `composeLocations`/`build-city` (regex `^[A-Z]{2,3}\d+-`, TDD) so future
      cities/regens don't reintroduce them. Watch for other mislabeled-but-clean
      names that name-match a famous venue at the wrong coordinates.
- [ ] **Widen the bbox?** — decide whether to expand the box to recapture the Old
      Sunshine Skyway fishing pier (south) and north-county golf (e.g. Bardmoor),
      which fell just outside. Bounds also gate the play-area map.
- [x] **Collapse same-business alternate-slug dupes in the pipeline.** Inclusive
      OSM pulls double-list a few businesses under near-identical names but
      different slugs. `dedupeByNameProximity` (in `apply-difficulty-lib.mjs`, TDD)
      now collapses rows that share a normalized name (with `&`→"and" and a
      trailing city token like "Seattle" stripped) **AND** sit within ~150 m,
      keeping the higher fame (id tie-break for determinism); same-name rows that
      are far apart are LEFT ALONE as genuine multi-location businesses. Verified
      across all five cities, exactly **one** true same-spot dupe collapsed:
      `moore-coffee-seattle` → `moore-coffee` (99 m). The other Seattle look-alikes
      are correctly kept as distinct: `spud-fish-and-chips`/`-chips` (12.5 km
      apart — a real two-location fish-and-chips), `westmans-bagel-and-coffee`/
      `…-coffee` (1.9 km), `wing-dome`/`wingdome`/`the-wing-dome`,
      `anchorhead-coffee`/`…-co`, `lula-coffee`/`…-co`, `an-nam-pho`/`annampho`
      (all > 150 m). Seattle 2390 → **2389**.
- [x] **Better tie-break at the play-cap boundary.** Fame scores are coarse
      (0–100 integers), so many rows tie right at the cap cut (Seattle: ~90 rows at
      **fame = 44** straddling the 500th in-play slot) and id-lexicographic order
      used to decide who plays — effectively alphabetical. Fixed: `byFameRank` (in
      `apply-difficulty-lib.mjs`) now ranks by fame, then **review count** (well
      populated in the fame cache — Seattle 2499/2782 non-zero), then id. It drives
      difficulty bucketing, the play cap, and the de-dupe survivor pick, so the more
      established of two equally-famous spots is preferred over the alphabetically
      earlier one. (A richer popularity signal — see _Precise popularity filter_ —
      could refine it further.)
- [ ] **Manual force-include famous OSM-untagged landmarks.** Seattle's fetch
      missed the **Fremont Troll** and **The Spheres** (tagged `tourism=artwork`/
      other, outside the `fetch-pois` allowlist). Add them (and any per-city
      equivalents) via `data/<id>-manual.json` with coords + hand-assigned
      difficulty, then re-run `apply-difficulty.mjs`. See DATA-SOURCING §4.
- [x] **Play cap per city (`City.playCap`) + non-food floor.** Every enriched
      row stays in the dataset with its `fameScore`; only the top-`playCap` by
      fame are `inPlay` and carry a difficulty (count-bucketed 40% easy / 40%
      medium / 20% hard). Caps: St. Pete 400 (375 rows, all in play), Ann Arbor
      300, State College 200, Seattle 500, Chicago 700. Daily selection filters
      to `inPlay`
      and enforces a **non-food floor** (`MIN_NON_FOOD_PER_DAY = 1`) so
      parks/landmarks aren't crowded out by food. Re-capping = re-run
      `apply-difficulty.mjs` off the committed fame cache (no re-research). See
      `docs/DATA-SOURCING.md` §4c, PLAN §5.

## Multi-city (shipped — extend as desired)

- [x] **City picker + 5 cities** — St. Pete, State College, Ann Arbor, Seattle,
      Chicago, via `cities.json` + `build-city`. Picker landing screen; per-city
      bounds/timezone/streaks.
- [ ] **More cities / region search** — add to `cities.json` + `build-city`. A
      type-to-search picker would scale better than buttons past ~10 cities.
- [ ] **Tune city bounds** — State College, Ann Arbor & Seattle tightened to the
      core. Chicago's box is still fairly broad; refine to taste and re-run
      `build-city`.

## Soon

- [ ] **Write location blurbs for every city** — the day recap (PLAN §5.13)
      ships with 4 demo St. Pete entries in `public/blurbs.stpete.json`; every
      other spot shows the rollout placeholder. Author the rest via web/LLM
      research (NOT Google Places — quota is for verification), in-play rows
      first, famous-first within a city; schema + rules in DATA-SOURCING §4f.
      Consider a `scripts/gen-blurbs-workflow.mjs` in the style of the fame
      pass for the big cities.

- [ ] **Photo rounds** — show a photo (e.g. the Don CeSar) instead of/alongside
      the name. `photoUrl` is already in the schema; source from Wikimedia
      Commons (free). v1 stays text-only by decision.
- [ ] **Clear the staged `react-hooks` v7 warnings** — `react-hooks/refs` and
      `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` are set to `warn` in `eslint.config.js`
      (staged during the ESLint 10 upgrade, PR #167); 7 violations across
      `App.tsx`, `MapGuess.tsx`, `DatasetSearch.tsx`. **They are benign only
      because this app uses no concurrent features** — no `Suspense`,
      `React.lazy`, `startTransition`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, or
      `useSyncExternalStore` anywhere in `src/`, so no render is discarded in
      production. (`main.tsx` does wrap the app in `StrictMode`, which
      double-renders in dev, but these writes converge.) **Fix these BEFORE
      adopting any of those** — the two ref sites fail differently:
      `App.tsx:130/135` (`sessionModeRef`) is the midnight-rollover bug — a
      discarded render advances the ref past the freeze, the next committed
      render sees matching selection seeds, and the player is silently
      yanked into the new day, defeating what `resolveSessionMode` exists
      for. `App.tsx:137` (`gameCtxRef`) is narrower: its payload is
      invariant across a day roll (`storageCityId` is `city.id` in official
      mode, `timeZone` comes from the city), so its hazard is a discarded
      render from a city switch or a `__shuffle`/`__date`/`__polygons`
      namespace change leaving the ref on a never-committed namespace,
      feeding `shouldDeferReload` the wrong saved state. Test-first per
      CLAUDE.md.
- [ ] **TypeScript 7 — blocked upstream, recheck periodically.** `typescript`
      majors are `ignore`d in `.github/dependabot.yml` because no
      `typescript-eslint` release supports TS 7: every version through
      `8.67.1-alpha.29` pins `peerDependencies.typescript: ">=4.8.4 <6.1.0"`,
      and forcing it crashes `typescript-estree`
      (`TypeError: ... reading 'Cjs'`), killing `npm run lint` — a required CI
      check. **TS 7 itself is fine in this repo**: it needs exactly one line,
      `"types": ["node"]` in `tsconfig.json` `compilerOptions`, because TS 7 no
      longer auto-includes `@types/node` (without it, `scripts/pin-day.ts` and
      `src/lib/seo-meta.test.ts` throw `TS2591`). Narrowing `types` is safe
      here — it only gates **ambient** auto-inclusion, and every other
      `@types` package in this repo (`react`, `react-dom`, `leaflet`,
      `canvas-confetti`) is module-typed and reached via `import`; vitest
      globals aren't enabled (tests import `describe`/`it`/`expect`
      explicitly), and `vite/client` comes from the triple-slash reference in
      `src/vite-env.d.ts`. `tsconfig.worker.json` already sets
      `types: ["node"]` itself. With that line, both typecheck passes, all
      tests and the build were verified clean (2026-08-24).
      **When `typescript-eslint` ships TS 7 support: remove the ignore entry,
      add the `types` line, done.**
- [ ] **Persistence / stats UI** — surface a stats panel + an "already played
      today" view (resume mid-day + streaks already work under the hood).
- [x] **Deploy to GitHub Pages** — DONE 2026-06-07 via
      `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`; now served at `knowyourcity.gg`.

## Later / nice-to-have

- [x] **Custom domain** — DONE 2026-06-10: `knowyourcity.gg` (Porkbun), Vite
      `base: '/'`, Pages custom domain + HTTPS. See `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.
- [ ] **Difficulty tiers (named, not "easy/medium/hard")** — the base
      easy/medium/hard difficulty SHIPPED (PR #40) and drives the daily ramp; this
      item is now the _optional_ polish of renaming/expanding those into a
      player-pickable ladder. Let the player pick how deep-cut the day's places
      are, from instantly-recognizable to only-a-regular-would-know. Proposed
      ladder (creative names, tune later):
      **Postcard** (marquee landmarks everyone knows — Don CeSar, Tropicana
      Field, Sunken Gardens) → **Local** (well-known spots + notable
      restaurants/bars) → **Insider** (neighborhood favorites) → **Deep Cut /
      Legend** (obscure small restaurants, dive bars, the long tail). Implement
      by scoring each location's "obscurity" (e.g. presence of a
      `wikipedia`/`wikidata` tag, `category`, and a future popularity signal —
      see _Precise popularity filter_ above) into a tier, then filter the daily
      pool by the chosen tier. Selection stays deterministic per day; tier just
      narrows the candidate set (and could feed the share string so friends
      compare tiers). Bigger datasets per city make the hard tiers viable.
- [ ] Scoring/difficulty tuning pass after real playtests (constants in
      `scoring.ts`).
- [ ] About/attribution panel (OSM ODbL + imagery credit) visible in the UI.
- [ ] **Prod-harden the bug worker's origin allowlist** — drop the `localhost`
      entries from `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` in `worker/wrangler.toml` once dev no longer
      needs them, so only the live Pages origin can use the public endpoint.
      (Deferred 2026-06-07; low priority — the per-IP rate limit + Turnstile
      already gate abuse.)
- [ ] **Share results: show numbers, not just colors** — the Wordle-style share
      is currently an emoji/color grid. Consider including the actual per-round
      scores (and the day's total, e.g. `420/500`) alongside or instead of the
      color squares, for people who want the real number. Keep it compact and
      spoiler-free (no place names). `buildShareString` in
      `src/components/Results.tsx`.
- [x] **Share results: link to the site** — the share text now ends with the
      game URL (`shareSiteUrl()` = origin + Vite `base`, so it's correct on Pages
      and a future custom domain). See `buildShareString` in
      `src/components/Results.tsx`.
- [x] **Optional backend for shared online leaderboards** — shipped (#92): the
      anonymous daily leaderboard (Cloudflare D1 worker `kyc-leaderboard`,
      `src/components/Leaderboard.tsx`, `src/lib/leaderboard.ts`), with a 90-day
      retention cron (#93). A **server-side per-player streak** (#95, migration
      `0002_create_streaks.sql`, `streaks` table) was added alongside it, keyed by
      anonymous client id and built to be accounts-ready. See PLAN §11 and
      `worker/README.md`. _Still open:_ named/account-based leaderboards.

## Done

- [x] **State College enriched + uncapped + parks fix** — removed the size cap
      (`target: null` → `composeLocations` keeps everything in-bounds), re-fetched
      (80 → 282), ran the fame pass, enriched to 234 rows (the 20/45/35
      percentile split at the time gave 47 easy / 105 medium / 82 hard; PR #59's
      play-cap re-run later set the in-play split to 200 rows at 80/80/40). A
      Google Places freshness sweep (Jun 2026) then removed 4 closed and renamed 4
      to current successors → 230 rows; a later whole-fleet freshness sweep removed
      1 more (Dulce Luca) → **229** rows (200 in play). Also
      fixed park under-fetching in `fetch-pois` (named green spaces no longer need a
      wiki tag) → **2 → 46 parks**. Tooling: `apply-difficulty.mjs`,
      `add-or-update-city` skill, `build-city.test.mjs`, `fetch-pois.test.mjs`.
- [x] **Difficulty system (St. Pete)** — per-location easy/medium/hard from a
      fame+status web-research pass, calibrated to a human local's blind ratings;
      daily plan switched to 2 easy → 2 medium → 1 hard; St. Pete cleaned 516→382
      (401 after the +19 parks/lakes pass, PR #49; **389** after the play-cap
      re-run, PR #59; **396** after the +7 player-requested/nearby-sweep adds,
      PR #74; **395** after removing the closed DeSanto Bar, issue #81; **398**
      after +3 John's Pass adds, issue #85; **397** after removing the closed
      McAuley's Pub; **396** after a Google Places freshness sweep — re-pin 7,
      rename 4 to successors, −5 closed, +4 new; **374** after removing 22
      national chains; **373** after a whole-fleet freshness sweep — −4 closed,
      +3 successors, `lastVerified` stamps; **370** after the four-city
      full-vetting pass removed 3 long-closed resort venues). PR #40. (Rollout to
      other cities tracked under _In progress / next_.)
- [x] Project scaffold + plan/docs (PLAN, DATA-SOURCING, QUESTIONS-FOR-ALEX).
- [x] Deterministic daily selection (midnight-Eastern, DST-aware) + 0–100 linear
      scoring, with unit tests.
- [x] CI (typecheck/lint/format/build/test/secret-scan).
- [x] Repo public + branch protection enforced (PR-only, required checks,
      delete-on-merge) — `scripts/protect-main.sh`.
- [x] Playable game (M3+M4+M6): Leaflet satellite map, pin-drop guessing,
      scoring + reveal, 5-round flow, results + Wordle share, localStorage
      resume + streaks.
- [x] Data pipeline (M2): Overpass scripts (fetch-pois / fetch-food /
      build-city) → per-city `public/locations.<id>.json` (St. Pete 375 +
      4 cities); the app loads the selected city's file; validated by a test.
- [x] Applied Alex's decisions: 0–100 linear scoring, midnight-ET rollover,
      clues hidden by default, whole-city start zoom.
